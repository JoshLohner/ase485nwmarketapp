Architectural Design:
Modular Structure:
The application is divided into distinct components (pages), each responsible for specific functionalities such as searching for items, displaying item details, and viewing price charts. This separation of concerns ensures that the code is easier to maintain and extend.
Data Management:
Local Storage with Hive: The application uses Hive for local data storage, which is ideal for Flutter applications due to its fast performance and ease of use. Data about items, once fetched from the API, is stored locally, reducing the need for repeated API calls and enabling offline access to some functionalities.
Asynchronous Data Fetching: API interactions are handled asynchronously, ensuring the UI remains responsive. This is critical for maintaining a smooth user experience, particularly when network responses are delayed.
API Integration:
The application communicates with an external API to fetch item names and prices. It processes JSON data and updates the UI based on this external information, demonstrating a typical client-server model in mobile app development.
State Management:
The use of StatefulWidget and local state management within each page allows the app to update the UI dynamically based on user interactions and data changes. This approach is straightforward and effective for the app's scope but could be evolved into using more advanced state management solutions (like Provider or BLoC) for larger applications.
Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are implemented, particularly in network requests, to manage exceptions like server errors or data fetch failures. This resilience is crucial for providing a reliable user experience.


User Interface (UI) Design:
Material Design:
The application leverages Flutter's Material components, offering a visually appealing and intuitive interface. Material Designâ€™s principles help in maintaining visual consistency across different screens.
Navigation:
The use of MaterialPageRoute facilitates smooth transitions between different pages, providing a clear navigation path from searching items to viewing detailed graphs.
Interactive Elements:
Interactive components such as text fields for search, buttons for adding or removing items, and clickable lists enhance user engagement. These elements are designed to be accessible and easy to use.
Visualizations:
The integration of fl_chart for rendering line charts offers a dynamic way to visualize data trends and comparisons, significantly enhancing the data presentation aspect of the app.
Responsive Layout:
The application's layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, a key feature in mobile applications to cater to various devices like phones and tablets.
